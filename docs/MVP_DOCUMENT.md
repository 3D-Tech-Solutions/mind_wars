### Alpha Build Generation

**Android APK:**
```bash
# Using build script (recommended)
./build-alpha.sh android

# Direct Flutter command
flutter build apk --flavor alpha --release --dart-define=FLAVOR=alpha

# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/mind-wars-v{version}-alpha.apk
```

**iOS App:**
```bash
# Using build script
./build-alpha.sh ios

# Direct Flutter command  
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign --dart-define=FLAVOR=alpha

# Output: build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app
```

### GitHub Actions Automation
- Automatic alpha APK builds on `main` branch push (artifacts)
- Manual workflow trigger for pre-release distribution
- Pre-release creation with version notes and download links

### Installation

**Android**:
1. Download APK from release/artifacts
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in device settings
3. Tap APK to install
4. Launch "Mind Wars Alpha"

**iOS**:
1. Connect device to macOS with Xcode
2. Select device as build target
3. Click Run (▶️) to install
4. Or use TestFlight for remote distribution

## Alpha Mode vs Production Mode

### Alpha Mode (Current - No Backend Required)

```
User Actions
    ↓
LocalAuthService (SQLite)
    ↓
Local User Database
    ↓
OfflineService (game storage)
    ↓
All Features Available Offline
```

**Configuration:**
```dart
const bool kAlphaMode = true;  // lib/main.dart
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Full game functionality without backend
- ✅ Local user accounts
- ✅ Offline gameplay
- ✅ Perfect for alpha testing & development
- ✅ Sync queue ready for future backend

### Production Mode (Backend Required)

```
User Actions
    ↓
AuthService (API)
    ↓
Backend Server (Node.js)
    ↓
PostgreSQL + Redis
    ↓
All Features + Multiplayer
```

**Configuration:**
```dart
const bool kAlphaMode = false;  // lib/main.dart

// Update API endpoints:
ApiService(baseUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com')
MultiplayerService.connect('https://multiplayer.yourdomain.com')
```

**Transition Checklist**:
1. Deploy backend infrastructure (docker-compose or cloud)
2. Update API URLs in `api_service.dart` and `multiplayer_service.dart`
3. Change `kAlphaMode = false`
4. Update `CORS_ORIGIN` in backend `.env`
5. Generate production signing certificates
6. Test full authentication flow
7. Deploy to app stores
